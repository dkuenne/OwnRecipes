# OwnRecipes Project

:warning: THIS PROJECT IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT PRODUCTION READY, YET. :warning:

<hr />

OwnRecipes is a recipe management site that allows users to create, share, and store their personal collection of recipes

This project was forked from OpenEats. See [the homepage](https://github.com/open-eats/OpenEats) for more information about OpenEats!

The usage for the app is intended for a single user or a small group. For my personal use, I would be an admin user and a few (about 5-6) friends and family would be normal users. Admin users can add other users to the project (no open sign-ups), make changes to the available Cuisines and Courses, and add to the homepage banner. Normal users just have the ability to add recipes. Below are a few of the core features the app provides.

- Creating, viewing, sharing, and editing recipes.
- Update Serving information on the fly.
- Browsing and searching for recipes.
- Creating grocery lists.
- Automatically add recipes to your grocery lists.
- Quickly print recipe.
- Linking recipes and ingredient grouping.

**Please note that OwnRecipes docker-functionality is neither tested nor being actively used. Main reasons are that OpenEats' wasn't working for me and that I do not care about it.**

Anyway, if you wish to use docker, you may try the OpenEats installation instructions from over here:
[OpenEats - Running_the_App With Docker](docs/Running_the_App.md)

But it is probably not working and needs to be fixed. Please feel free to PR the fix. üôè
