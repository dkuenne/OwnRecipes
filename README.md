# OwnRecipes Project

:warning: THIS PROJECT IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT PRODUCTION READY, YET. :warning:

<hr />

OwnRecipes is a recipe management site that allows users to create, share, and store their personal collection of recipes.

This project was forked from OpenEats. See [the homepage](https://github.com/open-eats/OpenEats) for more information about OpenEats!

The usage for the app is intended for a single user or a small group. For my personal use, I would be an admin user and a few (about 5-6) friends and family would be normal users. Admin users can add other users to the project (no open sign-ups), make changes to the available Cuisines and Courses, and add to the homepage banner. Normal users just have the ability to add recipes. Below are a few of the core features the app provides.

- Creating, viewing, sharing, and editing recipes.
- Ingredients can be grouped, and recipes include other recipes.
- Update serving information on the fly.
- Browsing and searching for recipes.
- Random search for explorers.
- Comments and ratings for recipes.
- Beautiful responsive design.

## Install

### Install via docker

**Release**:

Please note that currently no official docker images are provided.
If you want to deploy the app via docker, you will have to [build it from source](docs/Running_the_App_in_dev.md).

**From source**:

If you just want to run the whole thing for some testing or demo purpose, you can use docker, [build it from source](docs/Running_the_App_in_dev.md), and run it locally.
This is the most straight forward way, and you will have it up running in no time! :-)

### Install without docker

If for any reason you don't want to use docker, read the guide about [Running the App without Docker](docs/Running_the_App_Without_Docker.md),
This is also the preferred [method for Single-Board-Computers](docs/Running_the_App_Tricks.md/#single-board-computer).
